# Natural-Selection-2.0
My second attempt at simulating Natural Selection, this time a finished project. Turtles move around and evolve, allowing the user to observe Natural Selection with ease.

After running main.py, users will be greeted with a window showing the Natural Selection happening.
This project was inspired by Primer's version
